**description**

This is a project that showcases the a photo gallery which you can add photos to using the
"+" button. it also can change the name and info of the user using an "edit" button.

**technologies I used **

The main focus was making the website responsive & displayed correctly on popular screen sizes which was possible by using **@media** & **grid**.
I used **:hover** & **opacity** to make a the buttons change.
Used javascript **quesrySelector** to grab the users input and displasy changes accordingly.

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
